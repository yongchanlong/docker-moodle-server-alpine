All you need to get your lightweight [Moodle][moodle] instance.

Moodle
===

Lightweight docker container based on [Alpine Linux][alpine] includes Moodle 3.2, Apache,
PHP7.1, and all php-extensions required by Moodle.

Run container
---
```
$ docker run -p 80:80
             -v /var/moodledata:/var/moodledata
             -e "MOODLE_DB_TYPE=mysqli" \
             -e "MOODLE_DB_HOST=db" \
             -e "MOODLE_DB_NAME=moodle" \
             -e "MOODLE_DB_USER=moodle" \
             -e "MOODLE_DB_PASS=moodlepass" \
             -e "MOODLE_URL=http://localhost" \
              zebradil/moodle
```

As you see, some environment variables should be set. All of them must be
non-empty, except `MOODLE_DB_PASS` â€” it may be empty, but must be set.

At this time MySQL database only supported. It may work with MariaDB I didn't
check it.

Deploy stack
---
Instead of having a deal with database by your own, you could use stack provided.
```
$ MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root \
  MYSQL_DATABASE=moodle \
  MYSQL_USER=moodle \
  MYSQL_PASSWORD=moodlepass \
  MOODLE_URL=http://localhost \
  docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml moodle
```

Notice, that there are another set of environment variables here.

Moodle with [Coderunner][coderunner] plugin
---

All the same, but use another tag:
- `zebradil/moodle:coderunner

Inspired by bunch of [sergiogomez's docker-moodle forks](https://github.com/sergiogomez/docker-moodle).
